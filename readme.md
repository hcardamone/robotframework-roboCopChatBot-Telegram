# Welcome to roboCop Telegram-Bot

roboCop Telegram-Bot developed using the [Telegram Bot API Methods](https://core.telegram.org/api) to generated [Robot Framework's](https://robotframework.org/) Keywords.

## About

The purpose of this is help when finish the develop/tests receive notify of the roboCop Telegram-Bot.

## Requirements and tools

- ## Git SCM

  - Windows: Get last git [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Git Bash is recommended to work from Windows with almost the same features as Git on Linux.

- ## Python 3.10 or higher

  - Windows: get last Python installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setup Guide

## Python Virtual Environment

> **Hint**: On Git Bash you can find where Python is located run `which python` or `which python3`. Then you can set your path accordingly the correct Python version.

1. After cloning the project repository, then create the Python Virtual Environment `env` (can be the name you want)

   ```python
   cd ~/roboCopChatBot-Telegram
   $ python -m venv env
   ```

> **Hint**: `py -m pip install --user virtualenv` To install the python virtual environment

1. Add path setting to activate script

   ```python
   echo -e "\n# Sets PYTHONPATH var within virtualenv\nexport PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)" >> ./env/Scripts/activate
   ```

1. Activate the Virtual Environment, then you should see the **(env)** prefix in your bash prompt.

   ```python
   user@host: ~/roboCopChatBot-Telegram (branch)
   $ source ./env/Scripts/activate 
   (env)

> **Hint**: To exit `virtualenv` just type `deactivate`. To close Git Bash window type `exit`.

## roboCop Telegram-Bot dependencies

- ### Install Python packages: run this command

  ```python
  (env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

> **Hint** You can run this command on the Python virtual Environment.

## Visual Studio Code Plugins

VS Code is the recommended IDE, although barely anyone can be used.
These are suggested VS Code plugins that best fit this automation project:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) - a must have for all Python developers.
- [Robot Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=d-biehl.robotcode) - this is a very stronger robot framework extension. PS: The [Robot Framework Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomiTurtiainen.rf-intellisense) extension has been deprecated.
- [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) - YAML plugin supported by Red Hat, so no further comments.
- [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) - Optional but great extension to give a nice touch on file icons.
- [JSON Pretty Printer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=euskadi31.json-pretty-printer) - Optional but great extension to give a nice .json indentation.
- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - Optional but great extension to give autocomplete filenames.
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker#:~:text=Open%20up%20VS%20Code%20and,and%20reload%20window%20to%20enable.) - Optional but a great extension to check that works well with code and documentation.

## Running a Test Suite

1. First make a copy of file `telegram_variables_template.py`to your home user folder and remove the `-template` suffix.
2. File `telegram_variables` has all initial variables to run RF and you have to change to fit your machine settings as needed, since it won't be committed anyway as each automation developer can have different settings:

   - `HOST_GET_UPDATES = "https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/getMe"`  
      A simple method for testing your bot's auth token. There's aâ€¦ bot for that. Just talk to [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and follow a few simple steps. Once you've created a bot and received your authentication token, head down to the Bot API manual to see what you can teach your bot to do.
   - `HOST_SEND_MESSAGE = "https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/sendMessage"`  
      Use this method to send text messages. On success, the sent Message is returned.
   - `CHAT_ID = "YOURCHATID"`  
      Take the {YOURCHATID} value, it should be around 9 numbers. **_IMPORTANT_**: It's a security best practice to NEVER commit HOST_GET_UPDATES, HOST_SEND_MESSAGE and CHAT_ID in code repositories.

3. File `payload_template.json` contain the `BODY PARAMS`. `chat_id` is the _Unique_ _identifier_ for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format `@channelusername`). `text` to text of the _message_ to be sent. `parse_mode` Send **Markdown** or **HTML**, if you want Telegram apps to show bold, _italic_, fixed-width text or inline URLs in your bot's message. Optional `disable_web_page_preview` a boolean PARAM disables link previews for links in this message. `disable_notification` boolean sends the message silently. iOS users will not receive a notification, Android users will receive a notification with no sound. Other apps coming soon. `reply_to_message_id` if the message is a reply, ID of the original message. `reply_markup` additional interface options. A JSON-serialized object for a custom reply keyboard, instructions to hide keyboard or to force a reply from the user.
4. To run the `demo` test tag from demo.robot suite on another Git Bash / terminal window, activate the Python Virtual Environment as stated before and use this command:

   ```python
   (env) 
   $ robot --variablefile ./resources/python-telegram-bot/telegram-variables/telegram_variables.py --loglevel DEBUG --outputdir results ./tests/demo.robot
